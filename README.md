Project made for university task to implement HTML, CSS and Javascript with set amount of requirements.
For HTML site of project I utilized knowledge from laboratory works and used https://www.w3schools.com/html/ site for refrences, only extra thing is related to CSS the font awesome style which I added to my star system.
For CSS side again used https://www.w3schools.com/css/ site to get most of elements from there and with a lot of trail and error added some layout and design to my HTML elements. This isnt part at which I excel at
but I tried to make it look a bit pretty and not bland as default page.
For Javascript part of project I used variety of help be it from videos from lab exercises, w3schools site part for js mostly JS HTML DOM, JS BROWSER BOM, js event listeners, JS datatypes like arrays and functions on them 
and lastly googled and searched a lot of errors that I encountered or for solutions between different html pages I used.
